                Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine and a component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in which thin needles are inserted into the body to attempt pain relief. Because the existence of life force energy (Qi) or meridians
                is a major part of the body systems.

                Acupuncture is based on the ancient Daoist wu-xing, better known as the five elements or phases in the West. It can be used for a wide range of other conditions and in combination with other forms of treatment.
